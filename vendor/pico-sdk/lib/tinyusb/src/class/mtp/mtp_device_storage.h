/*
 * The entire MTP functionality is based on object handles, as described in MTP Specs v. 1.1 under 3.4.1.
 * The major weakness of the protocol is that those handles are supposed to be unique within a session
 * and for every enumerated object. There is no specified lifetime limit or way to control the expiration:
 * once given, they have to persist for an indefinite time and number of iterations.
 * If the filesystem does not provide unique persistent object handle for every entry, the best approach
 * would be to keep a full association between generated handles and full file paths. The suggested
 * approach with memory constrained devices is to keep a hard ID associated with each file or a volatile
 * ID generated on the fly and invalidated on each operation that may rearrange the order.
 * In order to invalidate existing IDS, it might be necessary to invalidate the whole session from
 * the device side.
 * Depending on the application, the handle could be also be the file name or a tag (i.e. host-only file access)
